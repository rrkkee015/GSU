## ðŸŽ® Game Overview (Summary)

**Gun Shot University (GSU)** is an action roguelike game where the player starts at maximum power and gradually becomes weaker as the game progresses. The final boss is the player's own strongest past self, creating a unique "reverse growth" challenge. Players must strategically choose which abilities to lose, adapting their playstyle as resources dwindle. The game features real-time combat, randomized stages, and a variety of elemental powers, each with unique effects. Enemies evolve as the player levels up, culminating in a dramatic final showdown. The visual style is intense and stylish, inspired by games like Hades and Dead Cells.
