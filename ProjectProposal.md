## 2. Core Concept

- **Reverse Growth**: The player controls a character who becomes weaker as the game progresses. (Starts with all abilities/skills/items â†’ gradually loses them one by one over time)
- **Final Boss is Your Past Self**: The final boss is "your strongest self" from the beginning of the game. The player must defeat their powerful past self in a weakened state.
- **Self-Overcoming/Reflection**: Instead of simple power-ups, the game requires creative and strategic play as resources and abilities decrease.
