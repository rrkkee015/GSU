## 2. Core Concept

- **Reverse Growth**: The player controls a character who becomes weaker as the game progresses. (Starts with all abilities/skills/items â†’ gradually loses them one by one over time)
- **Final Boss is Your Past Self**: The final boss is "your strongest self" from the beginning of the game. The player must defeat their powerful past self in a weakened state.
- **Self-Overcoming/Reflection**: Instead of simple power-ups, the game requires creative and strategic play as resources and abilities decrease.

## 5-1. Protagonist's Basic Movement

The protagonist moves using directional keys by default. Pressing the spacebar allows the protagonist to dash.

## 5-2. Protagonist's Elemental Abilities

The protagonist can wield various elemental powers, each with unique attack patterns and status effects.

- **Fire**: Deals powerful damage in a narrow cone in front of the player and inflicts Burn on enemies.
  - _Burn_: Deals damage over 4 seconds equal to 5% of the enemy's max HP
- **Ice**: Creates four spiraling ice storms centered on the player, dealing low damage and inflicting Freeze on enemies.
  - _Freeze_: Reduces enemy movement speed by 60% for 4 seconds
- **Earth**: Deals moderate damage in a wide circular area around the player, knocks enemies back, and grants the player Shell.
  - _Shell_: Grants a shield that blocks enemy attacks for 4 seconds
- **Lightning**: Deals moderate damage in a small area, strikes lightning at the enemy's position, and inflicts Shock.
  - _Shock_: Increases damage the enemy takes by 1.5x

Each elemental ability can be used strategically depending on the situation, and the player will lose these abilities one by one as the stages progress.
